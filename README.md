# Job-Portal-Figma

## What is this project? 
I made a Job Portal Website using Figma aimed at connecting job seekers with potential employers, contains(Home page, Signup/Login Page, Profile Page, Job Search Page, Contact Us Page).



## What are the tools you used to create it? 
I used different tools using FIGMA website to design Wireframe and Mockup, and of course i used prototypes to link the pages with each other.

The links for the Job Portal Website: [Premiem Job](https://www.figma.com/design/a4x7WaO07PIG3CzFf3nikQ/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=NKslNsZ4Yrw9YVsa-0)
